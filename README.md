# IBM Watson Chatbot

Watson was created as a question answering (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering.

I will explained how to make chatbots using IBM and believe me it is just 30 minutes practice. No need to write extra code and all stuff of Deployment of Chatbot just give some intents and integrate it as preview link or facebook messenger and slack etc whatever you can use by IBM.

**So Let's get started :**
_______________
First Basic step we have to do is that we have to make a IBM Account on [Link](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
* In this you just finish the verfication and all stuff that is required.

Then go to IBM dashboard but let me know that you are only have permission of making one Watson Assistant not two or three. 

Go to IBM Dashboard, then resources list and click on **Create Resources**
Choose Plan I suggest to choose LITE plan.

Soon I will share you the screen shots of IBM Watson.
