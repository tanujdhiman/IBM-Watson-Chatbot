# IBM Watson Chatbot

Watson was created as a question answering (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering.

I will explained how to make chatbots using IBM and believe me it is just 30 minutes practice. No need to write extra code and all stuff of Deployment of Chatbot just give some intents and integrate it as preview link or facebook messenger and slack etc whatever you can use by IBM.

**So Let's get started :**
_______________
First Basic step we have to do is that we have to make a IBM Account on [Link](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
* In this you just finish the verfication and all stuff that is required.

Then go to IBM dashboard but let me know that you are only have permission of making one Watson Assistant not two or three. 

When you click on IBM Cloud you can see the dashboard there. And just as

As we all know about the IBM, it is a huge platform of making not only chatbots but translators, discoveries, text to speech and vice versa etc.
In this we are gonna to make a simple chatbot by this you can have a idea of what and how watson work in actual or real-life.

In the navigation bar i.e three lines in the left of the dashboard page, click on that and then click on RESOURCES LIST. Here you can see the list of resoureces you have used and those you haven't use yet. We are gonna make a service name **Watson Assistant**. SO how will you approach that.
After clicking on Create Resourecs you will see a page like

Just Click on Watson Assistant and you will see a create page. In this there are a lot of text inputs like region, plan, watson etc.
I prefer to choose 
* Region - London if you are from the country in the given list then choose that.
* Plan - LITE if you haven't a subscription of IBM.
* Service Name - You have write watson-assistant-__ then you can write either of a number or alphabet like c9, 5n etc.

And in this page you just choose the plan and leave all in their default positions.Click on **Create**. Okay we are going to launch Watson Assistant and make sure you are with me on this page :
